Instructions for Graviton Rev. 3 routing

tie-il-cfg.SchDoc
- MIB bus is not reroutable (its actually already routed)
- any net on bank 3, 8, 7, and 0 can be swapped with any pin on bank 3, 8, 7, and 0
	-- (these are all 3.3V nets)
- any net on bank 4 can be swapped with any pin on bank 4
	-- (these are all 1.8V nets)



@dwasden @ryan @ben Hey guys, Graviton Rev. 3 is quickly coming together. If you recall from a long time ago we decided to remove the ETH/DAC/ADC FPGAs and instead use CS.





I saved the best for last which is the ADC/DAC/RGMII pin mapping. Ryan reminded me that this was the pin mapping we discussed.





Any new considerations or discussion on this block diagram?
