TODO

*Finish RXMIX external components
Are we ever going to want to use the shutdown features of all the RF parts?
*Fix the thing where power rails are global and that violates local supplies
*Check resistor thevenin values for switching supplies
*Restructure power to use 48V > 5V as the intermediate bus.
*Hook up DSA control
Add 2nd polarization
Hook up config FPGA
*Hook up T/R Switch
Eliminate negative Supply on DSA if possible
Raise voltage on T/R Swtich for better P1dB
JTAG Connector
