Why is P2V5 on FPGAs not decoupled?
much more decoupling needed in config bank 8
Add Buzzer
Add RF test points

Fix TI power pins
*Finish RXMIX external components
Are we ever going to want to use the shutdown features of all the RF parts?
*Fix the thing where power rails are global and that violates local supplies
*Check resistor thevenin values for switching supplies
*Restructure power to use 48V > 5V as the intermediate bus.
*Hook up DSA control
*Add 2nd polarization
*Hook up config FPGA
*Hook up T/R Switch
Eliminate negative Supply on DSA if possible
Raise voltage on T/R Swtich for better P1dB
*JTAG Connector
*Add differential clocks to all interfaces
*Create NOSWAP net classes
*Move GPMC to 3.3V IO?
*Create the VREFs
check common mode voltages for LVDS interfaces
switch to HCT logic for driving the TR switch
*figure out SSPI vs SSC question and update config fpga pin assignments
check all cap coupled stuff for common mode issues.
figure out startup clock for the cfg fpga
consider making both mixers single direct conversion
*terminate high speed clocks
check FPGA clock levels
terminate FPGA clocks
no GPMC to the config FPGA?

FPGA Bank Sheets Changes
 - Made Bank IO power into ports to allow assigning IO voltage from upper level, so the banks can stay generic.
 - S0 and S1 of both SDCC and DDRCC groups assigned to PCLK pins and given "NOSWAP" and Diff Pair directives.
 - Changed GPMC.xx harness connector entries to just xx (avoids creation of GPMC.GPMC.xx nets), same with SDRCC and GPIO8.
 - SDRCC port on schem symbols changed to SDRCCx
 - Moved GPMC to a 3.3V bank to interface more easily with BBB
