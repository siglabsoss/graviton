Layout Notes for Digital Routing of Graviton:

1. Scope:
	Route all nets in the net class 'digital' (approx, 1k nets)
2. Pin swapping:
	DO NOT SWAP PINS IN THE NET CLASS NOSWAP.
	Other than that, any pin can be swapped with the same net class in the following net classes:
		P1A.DDRCC
		P1A.SDRCC
		P1B.DDRCC
		P1B.SDRCC
		P2A.DDRCC
		P2A.SDRCC
		P2B.DDRCC
		P2B.SDRCC
		GPMC
		

3. Length matching:
	All routes in the following net classes should be matched to within 12mm:
	
		P1A.DDRCC
		P1A.SDRCC
		P1B.DDRCC
		P1B.SDRCC
		P2A.DDRCC
		P2A.SDRCC
		P2B.DDRCC
		P2B.SDRCC
		GPMC
		
	In addition, each of these nets must be length matched to within 12mm to their corresponding net class (they are not included in the net class because they are no swappable).
	All differential pairs must be length matched to 1.2mm of each other.
	
	
4. DDR3 interface
	This is standard DDR3 interface and consists of the following net classes:
		DDR-D
		DDR-A
		DDR-B
		DDR-DQS
	Swaps of pairs are possible, but only within DQS groups.  This means that DDR-D0 to DDR-D7 are swappable with each other but not with any other DDR-Dx.  Same with D8-15, D16-23, and D24-31.  DQS nets cannot be swapped.
	There is a good DDR layout checklist here: http://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/49555-102-1-259573/Freescale.Application_Note_4.pdf
	DDR3 must be routed with Fly-By topology
