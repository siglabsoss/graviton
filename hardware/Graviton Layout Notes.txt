Layout Notes for Digital Routing of Graviton:

1. Scope:
	Route all nets in the net class 'digital' (approx, 1k nets)

2. General Placement
	Try to keep all digital routes on the 'Digital' side of the line on mechanical layer 1.  Please consult with me if you need to deviate from this more than a few cmÂ².
	Route signals on all layers that are not power planes.
	
3. Pin swapping:
	DO NOT SWAP PINS IN THE NET CLASS 'NOSWAP'
	
	Other than that, any pin can be swapped with the same net class in the following net classes:
		P1A.DDRCC
		P1A.SDRCC
		P1B.DDRCC
		P1B.SDRCC
		P2A.DDRCC
		P2A.SDRCC
		P2B.DDRCC
		P2B.SDRCC
		GPMC
				

4. Length matching:
	All routes in the following net classes should be matched to within 6mm:
	
		P1A.DDRCC
		P1A.SDRCC
		P1B.DDRCC
		P1B.SDRCC
		P2A.DDRCC
		P2A.SDRCC
		P2B.DDRCC
		P2B.SDRCC
		GPMC
		
	In addition, each of these nets must be length matched to within 6mm to their corresponding clock net, for example P1A.DDRCC nets with differential clock pair P1A-DDRCCCLK_N and P1A-DDRCCCLK_P (they are not included in the net class because they are not swappable).
	All differential pairs must be length matched to 1.2mm of each other.
	
	
5. DDR3 interface
	This is s standard DDR3 interface and consists of the nets in net class 'DDR-ALL'.
	Each DQS group also has its own net class:
		DDR-DQS0
		DDR-DQS1
		DDR-DQS2
		DDR-DQS3
	
	Swaps of nets are possible, but only within DQS groups.  This means that DDR-D0 to DDR-D7 are swappable with each other but not with any other DDR-Dx.  Same with D8-15, D16-23, and D24-31.  DQS nets cannot be swapped.
	DDR3 must be routed with Fly-By topology and terminated.
	All DDR-ALL nets must be matched within 50.8mm.
	Each DDR-DQSx group must be further matched to within 0.508mm.
	There is a good DDR layout checklist here: http://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/49555-102-1-259573/Freescale.Application_Note_4.pdf
		
6.Bottom side clearance height is 6mm MAX.  Any components taller than 6mm must be placed on the TOP side.
	
7. Placement
	Do not move any locked components without consulting with us.
	All other components on the 'Digital' side of the line on Mechanical Layer 1 can be moved or rotated.
	Consult with us if you need to move anything on the Analog side of the line.

8. Trace width guidelines:

	50-ohm single-ended microstrip

		EXTERNAL
		Copper Thickness = 0.036mm (1oz top copper)
		Trace Width = 0.12mm

		INTERNAL
		Copper Thickness = 0.018mm (1/2oz internal copper)
		Trace Width = 0.14mm
	
	100-ohm Differential Pair

		EXTERNAL
		Trace Width = 0.076mm
		Differential gap = 0.127mm

		INTERNAL
		Trace Width = 0.076mm
		Differential gap = 0.08mm
